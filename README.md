# FAIR Code Checklist

âœ¨ This checklist helps you to make your code (more) Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. âœ¨

The FAIR principles originated in data management, but are as significant when writing a script, function, analysis, toolbox (any sort of code). Recently the FAIR principles have been rigorously applied to software in a [paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/DS-190026)

ðŸ’¡ To simplify your task, we created a checklist with easy-to-follow instructions that guide you through the process of making your code more FAIR. ðŸ’¡
